## Video Player 

FYI:
* I am going to be REALLY petty with this feedback, not to be mean, but for fun learning.
* This is a good chance for you to learn about Markdown syntax by looking at this file!



### Feedback 05-07-24

#### Bugs
* JS file is being loaded incorrectly

* Page content is not  horizontally and vertically centered.
* "Hotlinking" images is the most cursed thing you can do. ;)
* No background image on page
* Layout is not dynamic, page broken on mobile and smaller screens
* If the browser window is too small, i see scroll bars. Thats ugly!
* JS interactivity not added yet
* i can see the error that "http://localhost:8080/favicon.ico not found".. how could we fix that?
* lots of errors caused by giving permissions to the yourtube player (accelerometer, autoplay etc etc)


#### Possible Enhancements

* It would be nice not to see the Youtube controls. 
* If it takes time to load the youtube video, it would be nice to see a loading animation otherwise the user will think the page is broken.
* wouldn't it be cool if the list of youtube videos was loaded from an external json file, so you didnt have to update the code to change them.
* If you are going to use differnt fonts, use some sexy ones! - see link below
